# Switch statements code smell

The code starts to get smelly when you have lots of `if's` or `switch` statement in your code, and a refactoring become necessary in order to improve code readibility, scalability and maintenability.

Nothing special is necessary in order to run the code, both the _bad_ one and the *refactored*.

In the case you don't have *Typescript* install, you will have to do the next actions in order to be able to run the code inside de `after-ts` folder:

- `npm install -g typescript`
- `cd code-smells/switch-statements && tsc after.ts`
- `node after.js`

That's it : ).
